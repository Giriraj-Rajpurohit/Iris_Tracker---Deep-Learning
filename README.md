🚀 Iris Tracker: AI-Powered Eye Tracking 👁️✨
This Iris Tracker is a deep learning-powered system that detects and tracks eye positions with precision. 
Built on ResNet, it uses smart image augmentation to boost accuracy and handle variations in eye position, lighting, and angles.

🔥 Why It’s Cool
✅ AI-Powered Eye Detection – Learns to pinpoint eye locations in images.
✅ Smart Augmentation – Keeps data fresh with transformations while preserving keypoints.
✅ Effortless Label Handling – Reads, normalizes, and processes annotations seamlessly.
✅ Crystal Clear Visuals – Uses OpenCV & Matplotlib to overlay predictions on images.

⚡ How It Works
1️⃣ Prepares and augments eye-tracking data.
2️⃣ Trains a ResNet-based model to predict keypoints.
3️⃣ Runs on Apple M1 with Metal acceleration for efficiency.
4️⃣ Outputs predicted eye positions, which are visualized in real time.

🎯 Where It Shines
🔹 Gaze Tracking & HCI 🖥️
🔹 AR/VR Applications 🕶️
🔹 Assistive Tech ♿
🔹 AI Research & Innovation 🧠

A smooth, fast, and AI-driven approach to eye tracking! 🚀👀
